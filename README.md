This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure AI Search for data indexing and retrieval.

The repo includes sample data so it's ready to try end to end. In this sample application we use a fictitious company called Contoso Electronics, and the experience allows its employees to ask questions about the benefits, internal policies, as well as job descriptions and roles.

## Azure account requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

* **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started. See [guide to deploying with the free trial](docs/deploy_lowcost.md).
* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If your access request to Azure OpenAI service doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), you can use [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) instead. Learn [how to switch to an OpenAI instance](#openaicom-openai).
* **Azure account permissions**:
  * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](#existing-resource-group).
  * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

## Azure deployment

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/8ffbe5b1919c4c72aed89b022294df76) for the resources below.

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Document Intelligence: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure AI Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for various services, but those SKUs have limitations.
See this guide on [deploying with minimal costs](docs/deploy_lowcost.md) for more details.

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

You have a few options for setting up this project.
The easiest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup all the tools for you,
but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment) if desired.

#### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=599293758&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&location=WestUs2)

#### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
1. Open the project:
    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/azure-search-openai-demo)
1. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Now you can follow the instructions in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) below

#### Local environment

First install the required tools:

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

Then bring down the project code:

1. Create a new folder and switch to it in the terminal
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Run `azd init -t azure-search-openai-demo`
    * note that this command will initialize a git repository and you do not need to clone this repository

### Deploying from scratch

Execute the following command, if you don't have any pre-existing Azure services and want to start from a fresh deployment.

1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.
    * **Important**: Beware that the resources created by this command will incur immediate costs, primarily from the AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. You can run `azd down` or delete the resources manually to avoid unnecessary spending.
    * You will be prompted to select two locations, one for the majority of resources and one for the OpenAI resource, which is currently a short list. That location list is based on the [OpenAI model availability table](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) and may become outdated as availability changes.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.
It will look like the following:

!['Output from running azd up'](assets/endpoint.png)

> NOTE: It may take 5-10 minutes for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen or an error page, then wait a bit and refresh the page.

### Deploying with existing Azure resources

If you already have existing Azure resources, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values.

#### Existing resource group

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource group}`

#### Existing OpenAI resource

##### Azure OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE {Name of existing OpenAI service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group that OpenAI service is provisioned to}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing ChatGPT deployment}`. Only needed if your ChatGPT deployment is not the default 'chat'.
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing GPT embedding deployment}`. Only needed if your embeddings deployment is not the default 'embedding'.

When you run `azd up` after and are prompted to select a value for `openAiResourceGroupLocation`, make sure to select the same location as the existing OpenAI resource group.

##### Openai.com OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set OPENAI_HOST openai`
2. Run `azd env set OPENAI_ORGANIZATION {Your OpenAI organization}`
3. Run `azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY {Your OpenAI API key}`
4. Run `azd up`

You can retrieve your OpenAI key by checking [your user page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and your organization by navigating to [your organization page](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).
Learn more about creating an OpenAI free trial at [this link](https://openai.com/pricing).
Do *not* check your key into source control.

When you run `azd up` after and are prompted to select a value for `openAiResourceGroupLocation`, you can select any location as it will not be used.


#### Existing Azure AI Search resource

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE {Name of existing Azure AI Search service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group with ACS service}`
1. If that resource group is in a different location than the one you'll pick for the `azd up` step,
  then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_LOCATION {Location of existing service}`
1. If the search service's SKU is not standard, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_SKU {Name of SKU}`. If you specify the free tier, then your app will no longer be able to use semantic ranker, and it will use keys instead of managed identity for accessing the search service. Be advised that [search SKUs cannot be changed](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-sku-tier#tier-upgrade-or-downgrade). ([See other possible SKU values](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.search/searchservices?pivots=deployment-language-bicep#sku))
1. If you have an existing index that is set up with all the expected fields, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX {Name of existing index}`. Otherwise, the `azd up` command will create a new index.

You can also customize the search service (new or existing) for non-English searches:

1. To configure the language of the search query to a value other than "en-US", run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_LANGUAGE {Name of query language}`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/search-documents#queryLanguage))
1. To turn off the spell checker, run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_SPELLER none`. Consult [this table](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/search-documents#queryLanguage) to determine if spell checker is supported for your query language.
1. To configure the name of the analyzer to use for a searchable text field to a value other than "en.microsoft", run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_ANALYZER_NAME {Name of analyzer name}`. ([See other possible values](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.models.field.analyzer?view=azure-dotnet-legacy&viewFallbackFrom=azure-dotnet))

#### Other existing Azure resources

You can also use existing Azure AI Document Intelligence and Storage Accounts. See `./infra/main.parameters.json` for list of environment variables to pass to `azd env set` to configure those existing resources.

#### Provision remaining resources

Now you can run `azd up`, following the steps in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) above.
That will both provision resources and deploy the code.


### Deploying again

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```azd deploy```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```azd up```


## Sharing environments

To give someone else access to a completely deployed and existing environment,
either you or they can follow these steps:

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
1. Run `azd init -t azure-search-openai-demo` or clone this repository.
1. Run `azd env refresh -e {environment name}`
   They will need the azd environment name, subscription ID, and location to run this command. You can find those values in your `.azure/{env name}/.env` file.  This will populate their azd environment's `.env` file with all the settings needed to run the app locally.
1. Set the environment variable `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` either in that `.env` file or in the active shell to their Azure ID, which they can get with `az ad signed-in-user show`.
1. Run `./scripts/roles.ps1` or `.scripts/roles.sh` to assign all of the necessary roles to the user.  If they do not have the necessary permission to create roles in the subscription, then you may need to run this script for them. Once the script runs, they should be able to run the app locally.

## Enabling optional features

### Enabling GPT-4 Turbo with Vision

This section covers the integration of GPT-4 Vision with Azure AI Search. Learn how to enhance your search capabilities with the power of image and text indexing, enabling advanced search functionalities over diverse document types. For a detailed guide on setup and usage, visit our [Enabling GPT-4 Turbo with Vision](docs/gpt4v.md) page.

### Enabling authentication

By default, the deployed Azure web app will have no authentication or access restrictions enabled, meaning anyone with routable network access to the web app can chat with your indexed data.  You can require authentication to your Azure Active Directory by following the [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service) tutorial and set it up against the deployed web app.

To then limit access to a specific set of users or groups, you can follow the steps from [Restrict your Azure AD app to a set of users](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users) by changing "Assignment Required?" option under the Enterprise Application, and then assigning users/groups access.  Users not granted explicit access will receive the error message -AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application <app_name> to block users unless they are specifically granted ('assigned') access to the application.-

### Enabling login and document level access control

By default, the deployed Azure web app allows users to chat with all your indexed data. You can enable an optional login system using Azure Active Directory to restrict access to indexed data based on the logged in user. Enable the optional login and document level access control system by following [this guide](./LoginAndAclSetup.md).

### Enabling CORS for an alternate frontend

By default, the deployed Azure web app will only allow requests from the same origin.  To enable CORS for a frontend hosted on a different origin, run:

1. Run `azd env set ALLOWED_ORIGIN https://<your-domain.com>`
2. Run `azd up`

For the frontend code, change `BACKEND_URI` in `api.ts` to point at the deployed backend URL, so that all fetch requests will be sent to the deployed backend.

For an alternate frontend that's written in Web Components and deployed to Static Web Apps, check out
[azure-search-openai-javascript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript) and its guide
on [using a different backend](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript#using-a-different-backend).

## Running locally

You can only run locally **after** having successfully run the `azd up` command. If you haven't yet, follow the steps in [Azure deployment](#azure-deployment) above.

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` or `./start.sh` or run the "VS Code Task: Start App" to start the project locally.

See more tips in [the local development guide](docs/localdev.md).

## Using the app

* In Azure: navigate to the Azure WebApp deployed by azd. The URL is printed out when azd completes (as "Endpoint"), or you can find it in the Azure portal.
* Running locally: navigate to 127.0.0.1:50505

Once in the web app:

* Try different topics in chat or Q&A context. For chat, try follow up questions, clarifications, ask to simplify or elaborate on answer, etc.
* Explore citations and sources
* Click on "settings" to try different options, tweak prompts, etc.

## Monitoring with Application Insights

By default, deployed apps use Application Insights for the tracing of each request, along with the logging of errors.

To see the performance data, go to the Application Insights resource in your resource group, click on the "Investigate -> Performance" blade and navigate to any HTTP request to see the timing data.
To inspect the performance of chat requests, use the "Drill into Samples" button to see end-to-end traces of all the API calls made for any chat request:

![Tracing screenshot](docs/transaction-tracing.png)

To see any exceptions and server errors, navigate to the "Investigate -> Failures" blade and use the filtering tools to locate a specific exception. You can see Python stack traces on the right-hand side.

You can also see chart summaries on a dashboard by running the following command:

```shell
azd monitor
```

## Customizing the UI and data

Once you successfully deploy the app, you can start customizing it for your needs: changing the text, tweaking the prompts, and replacing the data. Consult the [app customization guide](docs/customization.md) as well as the [data ingestion guide](docs/data_ingestion.md) for more details.

## Productionizing

This sample is designed to be a starting point for your own production application,
but you should do a thorough review of the security and performance before deploying
to production. Read through our [productionizing guide](docs/productionizing.md) for more details.

## Clean up

To clean up all the resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`
3. When asked if you want to permanently delete the resources, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.


### FAQ

<details><a id="compare-samples"></a>
<summary>How does this sample compare to other Chat with Your Data samples?</summary>

Another popular repository for this use case is here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT/

That repository is designed for use by customers using Azure OpenAI studio and Azure Portal for setup. It also includes `azd` support for folks who want to deploy it completely from scratch.

The primary differences:

* This repository includes multiple RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approaches that chain the results of multiple API calls (to Azure OpenAI and ACS) together in different ways. The other repository uses only the built-in data sources option for the ChatCompletions API, which uses a RAG approach on the specified ACS index. That should work for most uses, but if you needed more flexibility, this sample may be a better option.
* This repository is also a bit more experimental in other ways, since it's not tied to the Azure OpenAI Studio like the other repository.

</details>

<details><a id="switch-gpt4"></a>
<summary>How do you use GPT-4 with this sample?</summary>

In `infra/main.bicep`, change `chatGptModelName` to 'gpt-4' instead of 'gpt-35-turbo'. You may also need to adjust the capacity above that line depending on how much TPM your account is allowed.
</details>

<details><a id="azd-up-explanation"></a>
<summary>What does the `azd up` command do?</summary>

The `azd up` command comes from the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview), and takes care of both provisioning the Azure resources and deploying code to the selected Azure hosts.

The `azd up` command uses the `azure.yaml` file combined with the infrastructure-as-code `.bicep` files in the `infra/` folder. The `azure.yaml` file for this project declares several "hooks" for the prepackage step and postprovision steps. The `up` command first runs the `prepackage` hook which installs Node dependencies and builds the React.JS-based JavaScript files. It then packages all the code (both frontend and backend) into a zip file which it will deploy later.

Next, it provisions the resources based on `main.bicep` and `main.parameters.json`. At that point, since there is no default value for the OpenAI resource location, it asks you to pick a location from a short list of available regions. Then it will send requests to Azure to provision all the required resources. With everything provisioned, it runs the `postprovision` hook to process the local data and add it to an Azure AI Search index.

Finally, it looks at `azure.yaml` to determine the Azure host (appservice, in this case) and uploads the zip to Azure App Service. The `azd up` command is now complete, but it may take another 5-10 minutes for the App Service app to be fully available and working, especially for the initial deploy.

Related commands are `azd provision` for just provisioning (if infra files change) and `azd deploy` for just deploying updated app code.
</details>

<details><a id="appservice-logs"></a>
<summary>How can we view logs from the App Service app?</summary>

You can view production logs in the Portal using either the Log stream or by downloading the default_docker.log file from Advanced tools.

The following line of code in `app/backend/app.py` configures the logging level:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=os.getenv("APP_LOG_LEVEL", default_level))
```

To change the default level, either change `default_level` or set the `APP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
to one of the [allowed log levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels):
`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.

If you need to log in a route handler, use the the global variable `current_app`'s logger:

```python
async def chat():
    current_app.logger.info("Received /chat request")
```

Otherwise, use the `logging` module's root logger:

```python
logging.info("System message: %s", system_message)
```

If you're having troubles finding the logs in App Service, see this blog post on [tips for debugging App Service app deployments](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/06/tips-for-debugging-flask-deployments-to.html) or watch [this video about viewing App Service logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-aYuvws54).
</details>

### Troubleshooting

Here are the most common failure scenarios and solutions:

1. The subscription (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) doesn't have access to the Azure OpenAI service. Please ensure `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` matches the ID specified in the [OpenAI access request process](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

1. You're attempting to create resources in regions not enabled for Azure OpenAI (e.g. East US 2 instead of East US), or where the model you're trying to use isn't enabled. See [this matrix of model availability](https://aka.ms/oai/models).

1. You've exceeded a quota, most often number of resources per region. See [this article on quotas and limits](https://aka.ms/oai/quotas).

1. You're getting "same resource name not allowed" conflicts. That's likely because you've run the sample multiple times and deleted the resources you've been creating each time, but are forgetting to purge them. Azure keeps resources for 48 hours unless you purge from soft delete. See [this article on purging resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/manage-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource).

1. You see `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when the `prepdocs.py` script runs. That's typically due to incorrect SSL certificates setup on your machine.
