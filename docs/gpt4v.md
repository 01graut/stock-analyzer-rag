# Enabling GPT-4 Turbo with Vision

This repository now includes an example of integrating GPT-4 Turbo with Vision with Azure AI Search. This feature enables indexing and searching images and graphs, such as financial documents, in addition to text-based content.

## Feature Overview

- **Document Handling:** Source documents are split into pages and saved as PNG files in blob storage. Each file's name and page number are embedded for reference.
- **Data Extraction:** Text data is extracted using OCR.
- **Data Indexing:** Text and image embeddings, generated using Azure AI Vision ([Azure AI Vision Embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/image-retrieval)), are indexed in Azure AI Search along with the raw text.
- **Search and Response:** Searches can be conducted using vectors or hybrid methods. Responses are generated by GPT-4 Turbo with Vision based on the retrieved content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Create a [Computer Vision account in Azure Portal first](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision), so that you can agree to the Responsible AI terms for that resource. You can delete that account after agreeing.
- The ability to deploy a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model in the [supported regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-preview-model-availability). If you're not sure, try to create a deployment from your Azure OpenAI deployments page. You should be able to select: 

   | Model | Version |
   |--|--|
   |`gpt-4`|`vision-preview`|

- Ensure that you can deploy the Azure OpenAI resource group in [a region where all required components are available](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability):
    - Azure Open AI models
        - gpt-35-turbo
        - text-embedding-ada-002
        - gpt-4v
    - [Azure AI Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/)

### Setup and Usage

1. **Update repository:**
   Pull the latest changes.

2. **Enable GPT-4 Turbo with Vision:**
   Set the environment variable with `azd env set USE_GPT4V true`. This flag is used to deploy necessary components for vision fuctionality and to toggle UI components.

3. **Clean old deployments (optional):**
   Run `azd down --purge` for a fresh setup.

4. **Start the application:**
   Execute `azd up` to build, provision, deploy, and initiate document preparation.


5. **Web Application Usage:**

   - Access the developer options in the web app and select "Use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision".
   - Sample questions will be updated for testing.
   - Interact with the questions to view responses.
   - The 'Thought Process' tab shows the retrieved data and its processing by GPT-4 Turbo with Vision.
