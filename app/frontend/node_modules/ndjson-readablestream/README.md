# ndjson-readablestream

A small JS package for reading a ReadableStream of NDJSON.

`readNDJSONStream()` accepts a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) object,
and returns an [AsyncGenerator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator) where each yielded event is a valid JSON object.

Example usage:

```javascript
import readNDJSONStream from "ndjson-readablestream";

const response = await fetch("/chat", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    body: JSON.stringify({message: "Hi, how are you?"})
});
for await (const event of readNDJSONStream(response.body)) {
    console.log("Received", event);
}
```

Example usage in a webpage:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ndjson-readablestream@1.0.1/dist/ndjson-readablestream.umd.js"></script>
<script>
const response = await fetch("/chat", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    body: JSON.stringify({message: "Hi, how are you?"})
});
for await (const event of readNDJSONStream(response.body)) {
    console.log("Received", event);
}
</script>
```
